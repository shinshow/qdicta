## How It Works

1. Press the hotkey (default: `Option + Space`)
2. Speak — a recording overlay appears on screen
3. Press the hotkey again to stop
4. Your speech is transcribed locally and pasted into the active text field

Everything runs on-device using [MLX](https://github.com/ml-explore/mlx). No audio leaves your Mac.

## Features

- **On-device transcription** — Qwen3-ASR running via mlx-audio, no cloud API needed
- **Global hotkey** — trigger from any app, configurable in Settings
- **Menu bar app** — lives quietly in your status bar
- **Recording overlay** — visual feedback with audio level bars and timer
- **ESC to cancel** — press Escape during recording to dismiss without transcribing
- **Auto-paste** — transcribed text is pasted directly into the active field
- **Guided onboarding** — first launch walks you through permissions and model download

## Requirements

- macOS 13+ on Apple Silicon (M1/M2/M3/M4)
- ~2 GB disk space for the ASR model
- `ffmpeg` installed when running from source
- Microphone permission
- Accessibility permission (for global hotkey)

## Installation

### From Source

```bash
# Clone
git clone https://github.com/shaircast/vvrite.git
cd vvrite

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
brew install ffmpeg

# Run
python -m vvrite
```

### Build as .app

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
./scripts/build.sh
open dist/vvrite.dmg
```

`./scripts/build.sh` is the supported build path. It performs the PyInstaller build, code signing, notarization, stapling, and DMG creation. It requires a configured Apple Developer signing identity and `notarytool` profile.

## Usage

| Action | Shortcut |
|---|---|
| Start / stop recording | `Option + Space` (configurable) |
| Cancel recording | `Escape` |
| Open settings | Click menu bar icon → Settings |

On first launch, the onboarding wizard will guide you through:
1. Granting microphone and accessibility permissions
2. Setting your preferred hotkey
3. Downloading the ASR model (~1.7 GB)
